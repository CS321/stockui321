This is a Netbeans project containing the required code for assignment 3.

TO USE MY TEST USERS:
I have made 3 users if you would like to see some data:
user:trey pass:testing
user:test pass:testing
user:testuser pass:testing1

Inside are the following Packages:

Structure - Contains Table, StructuredTable, and supporting classes. This is the 2D table structure that is the basis for most of this program.
Stocks - Contains TraderAccount, Market, and View Strategies. This handles transactions and market quotes.
Users - Contains Account class and password encryption stuff. This holds all of our TraderAccount instances and can be saved to a file.
System - Contains Main, Database reading/writing (Serialization), and Logging stuff.
TextUI - Contains StockUI, Prompt, and Input Validator Strategies, this is where everything comes together.

I have tested this on NetBeans IDE 7.2.1, OSX 10.8.2, and Java 1.6.0_37 64-bit.
