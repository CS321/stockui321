CS321-1 Assignment 3
UAH, Dr. Zhang

Assignment brief:
 Implement basic stock trading TUI using previous assignment work.

Task1: Extended Table to StructuredTable which enforces same Types per column, this is generic enough to be used for other things. I then created a TraderAccount which contains a StructuredTable as its member (along with other user information).
Task2: The TextUI Package contains the StockUI class, a Prompt class, and a set of (Strategy Design Pattern) input validation classes.
Task3: I used the Strategy Design Pattern to present the UI with a different views of the data (Portfolio, Lots, etc), a new StructuredTable snapshot is sent as requested and the UI handles sorting the columns as needed. The Market page allows for real-time quotes and buy/sell.
Task4: All abstraction layers are separated into their own package, representations are not exposed between the layers.
Task5: A log file is kept (stocks.log) of all transactions. the Accounts table is also saved/retrieved on exit/startup.
Task6: I used Strategy Design Pattern to present each view of an account's data (Portfolio, Lot, Closed Position, Transactions), it's not very efficient but it hides the complexity and was a good learning experience. I also used SDP to implement input validation in the Prompt class. The Market class is a Singleton because there should be only one.
